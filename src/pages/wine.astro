  <h1>WINE AND SNACK</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>

    <p>Welcome to the world of wine at Panache — where the only rule is that there are no rules (well, except maybe not chugging a 2012 Bordeaux like it’s soda). Here, wine isn’t just a drink; it’s a mood, a story in a glass, and sometimes even a therapist in a bottle. Whether you’re a seasoned sommelier or someone who simply loves a good swirl-and-sniff, our menu is designed to delight your palate and spark your curiosity.

So grab a glass, explore our carefully curated selection, and let’s uncork some fun together. Cheers to new flavors, good company, and the unique vibe that only Panache can offer!
